# Configuration

All global configuration can be either set as environment variables, or in the `.env` file (the exact location is printed when you run `micro`).

```bash
# set default config for micro
MSWEA_LOCAL_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/your/own/config"
# set default model
MSWEA_MODEL_NAME="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
```
