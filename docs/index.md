<h1>The 100 line AI agent that's actually useful</h1>
</div>


In 2024, [SWE-bench](https://swebench.com) & [SWE-agent](https://swe-agent.com) helped kickstart the agentic AI for software revolution. In 2025, we ask:
**What if the agent was 100x smaller, and still worked nearly as well?**

`micro` is for

- üß™ **Researchers** who want to **benchmark, fine-tune or RL** without assumptions, bloat, or surprises
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Hackers & power users** who like their tools like their scripts: **short, sharp, and readable**
- üê≥ **Engineers** who want something **trivial to sandbox & to deploy anywhere**

Here's some details:

- **üêú Minimal**: Just [100 lines of python](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/src/microsweagent/agents/default.py) (+100 total for [env](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/src/microsweagent/environments/micro.py),
[model model](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/src/microsweagent/models/litellm_model.py), [script](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/src/microsweagent/run/hello_world.py)) ‚Äî no fancy dependencies!
- **üí™ Powerful:** Resolves XX% of GitHub issues in the [SWE-bench verified benchmark](https://www.swebench.com/).
- **ü§ó Friendly:** Comes with **two convenient UIs** that will turn this into your daily dev swiss army knife!
- **üçÄ Environments:** In addition to local envs, you can use **docker**, **podman**, **singularity**, **apptainer**, and more
- **üéì Cutting edge:** Built by the Princeton & Stanford team behind [SWE-bench](https://swebench.com) and [SWE-agent](https://swe-agent.com).

??? note "Why use micro-SWE-agent for research?"

    [SWE-agent](https://swe-agent.com/latest/) jump-started the development of AI agents in 2024. Back then, we placed a lot of emphasis on tools and special interfaces for the agent. However, one year later, a lot of this is not needed at all to build a useful agent!

    In fact, micro-SWE-agent:

    - **Does not have any tools other than bash** ‚Äî it doesn't even use the tool-calling interface of the LMs. This means that you can run it with literally any model. When running in sandboxed environments you also don't need to take care of installing a single package ‚Äî all it needs is bash.
    - **Has a completely linear history** ‚Äî every step of the agent just appends to the messages and that's it. So there's no difference between the trajectory and the messages that you pass on to the LM.
    - **Executes actions with `subprocess.run`** ‚Äî every action is completely independent (as opposed to keeping a stateful shell session running). This makes it trivial to execute the actions in sandboxes (literally just switch out `subprocess.run` with `docker exec`) and to scale up effortlessly.

    This makes it perfect as a baseline system and for a system that puts the language model (rather than the agent scaffold) in the middle of our attention.

??? note "Why use micro-SWE-agent as a tool?"

    Some agents are overfitted research artifacts. Others are UI-heavy tools, highly optimized for a specific user experience. Both variants are hard to understand.

    `micro` wants to be:

    - **Simple** enough to understand at a glance
    - **Convenient** enough to use in daily workflows
    - **Flexible** to extend

    A hackable tool, not a black box.

    Unlike other agents (including our own [swe-agent](https://swe-agent.com/latest/)), it is radically simpler, because it:

    - Does not have any tools other than bash ‚Äî it doesn't even use the tool-calling interface of the LMs.
    - Has a completely linear history ‚Äî every step of the agent just appends to the messages and that's it.
    - Executes actions with `subprocess.run` ‚Äî every action is completely independent (as opposed to keeping a stateful shell session running).

??? note "Should I use SWE-agent or micro-SWE-agent?"

    You should use micro-swe-agent if

    - You want a quick command line tool that works locally
    - You want an agent with a very simple control flow
    - You want even faster, simpler & more stable sandboxing & benchmark evaluations

    You should use swe-agent if

    - You need specific tools or want to experiment with different tools
    - You want to experiment with different history processors
    - You want very powerful yaml configuration without touching code

    What you get with both

    - Excellent performance on SWE-Bench
    - A trajectory browser
